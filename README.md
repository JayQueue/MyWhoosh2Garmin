What if you want to automate the whole process:
<h3>MacOS</h3>
AppleScript

```applescript
-- Define the text file path to store mywhoosh.app's location
set textFilePath to (POSIX path of (path to me)) & "mywhoosh_path.txt"

-- Read the stored path from the text file
set mywhooshPath to ""
try
    set mywhooshPath to do shell script "cat " & quoted form of textFilePath
on error
    set mywhooshPath to ""
end try

-- Check if the stored path is valid
if mywhooshPath is not "" then
    try
        do shell script "test -d " & quoted form of mywhooshPath
    on error
        set mywhooshPath to ""
    end try
end if

-- Search for mywhoosh.app if no valid path is found
if mywhooshPath is "" then
    set mywhooshPath to do shell script "mdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"mywhoosh.app\"' | head -n 1"
    if mywhooshPath is "" then
        return -- Exit if mywhoosh.app is not found
    end if
    -- Store the path in the text file
    do shell script "echo " & quoted form of mywhooshPath & " > " & quoted form of textFilePath
end if

-- Run mywhoosh.app
tell application "Finder"
    open application file mywhooshPath
end tell

-- Wait for mywhoosh to finish
repeat
    set appRunning to (do shell script "ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -c " & quoted form of "mywhoosh.app") as integer
    if appRunning = 0 then exit repeat
    delay 5
end repeat

-- Run the Python script
do shell script "python3 /path/to/mywhoosh.py"

Bash
