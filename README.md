    delay 1
end repeat

-- Run the Python script
do shell script "python3 ~/path/to/mywhoosh.py"

```
Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the mywhoosh.app application
APP_PATH="/Applications/mywhoosh.app"

# Start the mywhoosh.app and wait for it to finish
echo "Starting mywhoosh.app..."
open -W "$APP_PATH"

# Check if the application exited successfully
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "mywhoosh.app has finished. Now running Python script..."
    # Run the Python script
    python3 mywhoosh.py
