<h1>Apple Script to automate Garmin Upload</h1>
<p>The app will run and constantly check (every 30 seconds) whether MyWhoosh is running. Once started, it will listen to My Whoosh being quit/exited. In case My Whoosh was exited/quit, it will run the myWhoosh2Garmin.py script that needs to be installed and setup previously.</p>
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download MyWhoosh2Garmin-AS.scpt to your filesystem to a folder of your choosing.</li>
  <li>Go to the folder where you downloaded the script via Mac Finder.</li>
  <li>Open the script in the Apple Script Editor and set the property <code>pythonScriptPath</code> to the location where you downloaded the 
  <code>myWhoosh2Garmin.py</code> script.</li>
  
```
property targetApp : "MyWhoosh Indoor Cycling App"
property pythonScriptPath : "/path/to/myWhoosh2Garmin.py"
property appRunning : false

on idle
	if application targetApp is running then
		set appRunning to true
	else if appRunning then
		set appRunning to false
		performActionOnExit()
	end if
	return 30 -- Check every 30 seconds
end idle

on performActionOnExit()
	do shell script "python3 " & quoted form of pythonScriptPath
end performActionOnExit

on quit
	continue quit
end quit

```

  <li>Store the app at a location of your choice.</li>
